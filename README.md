# GatsbyJS Headless Ecommerce Store

This is a store that I created for my friends to sell band merchandise.

## Description

Built using GatsbyJS. GraphQL and the Shopify API are used to fetch product data from the backend which is managed with Shopify's CMS. Inventory is managed by Prinful's API, which passes information to Shopify.

### Built with [GatsbyJS Shopify Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-shopify)
