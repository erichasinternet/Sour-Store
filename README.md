# Discontinued - This project has met its end.

Gatsby is dying, we're in dependency hell, and we're out of date with the latest Shopify schema. 

I've decided to abandon this project and create something new. So long, Gatsby! ðŸ‘‹

# GatsbyJS Headless E-commerce Store

This is a store that I created for my friends to sell band merchandise.

## Description

Built using GatsbyJS. 

GraphQL and the Shopify API are used to fetch product data from the backend which is managed with Shopify's CMS. 

Inventory is managed by Prinful's API, which passes information to Shopify.

### Built with [GatsbyJS Shopify Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-shopify)
